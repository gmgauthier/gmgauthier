#### Bio

Born and raised in Chicago. Presently living in Oxford, UK. I'm a veteran tech nerd with a wide array of experiences. I'm most experienced with Java, but my favorite modern programming language is Python. My favorite all-time programming language is Rexx. I like tinkering with Atari 8-bit and old MS DOS computers in my free time. You can watch me here, if you're bored: https://rumble.com/c/gmgauthier2
